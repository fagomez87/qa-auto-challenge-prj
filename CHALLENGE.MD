# ASAPP - QA Automation Challenge

## What is this about?

We're giving you the source code of an absolutely non-impressive and flaky web store. You're likely to find some bugs, and you'll probably notice some imperfections in the design. Your goal is to define and document a Testing Strategy, and implement an initial suite of tests.

## Expected output

**(1) Testing Strategy**

We'd like to see a short document detailing your strategy choices.

You can use the list below as a guideline, but feel free to include anything else you consider relevant.

- Why did you choose a particular testing layer?
- What was your criteria for the intial suite?
- If this was an actual project, which would be your next steps?
- What sort of tradeoffs did you make in your implementation? What sorts of things would you implement differently if you were desiging a framework to test productionized code? 

**(2) Implementation**

The strategy will help us understand how you think, but we'd also like to see how you would implement it. We expect you to write a basic framework structure and a few tests in one or more layers.

Some guidelines:
- You're free to use the language and libs you feel more comfortable with, as long as the project is runnable. Bonus points if you include a README.
- You can build the framework/tests around the app source code, as a standalone project, or both.
- We don't expect a fully fledged framework, we just want to understand how you would model/structure an Automation project.
- Although we're leaving the testing layers splitting decisions to you, be prepared to answer questions about it. Please use docstrings/in-line comments where necessary to explain your decisions or thought process. Again, your reasoning and being able to explain/defend your decision-making is just as important as the code implementation.
- If you built a standalone project, bonus points if we can execute it as a docker container.


If you have any questions feel free to contact us!

## How do I start?

Together with this document you should have received a zip file containing the project source files. Follow the README file for setup/execution instructions.
